## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student passionate about building a **strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and machine learning**.  
I enjoy breaking down complex concepts into clean implementations and applying them to real-world datasets and academic projects.

Most of my work focuses on:
- Writing **clear, understandable code**
- Learning by **implementing from scratch**
- Solving problems that actually make sense outside textbooks

## 🧠 What I Work On

### 💻 Data Structures & Algorithms
- Binary Search, Sorting Algorithms  
- Greedy Algorithms (Knapsack, Job Sequencing)  
- Graph Algorithms (Floyd–Warshall, TSP)  
- Backtracking & Branch and Bound (N-Queens, 15 Puzzle)  
- Huffman Coding, Optimal BST  

### 🤖 Machine Learning & AI
- Decision Trees, Random Forest
- KNN, K-Means Clustering
- PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)
- Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering
- Model evaluation and interpretation

### 📊 Projects
- End-to-end ML projects using real datasets  
- Academic projects with proper documentation  
- Focus on **practical usage, not just theory**
